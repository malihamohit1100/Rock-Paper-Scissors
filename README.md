<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a recreation of Rock Paper Scissors Game. Rock paper scissors is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".This solo project was developed in VSC using JavaScript as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!<br/>
In Rock Paper Scissors Game, at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. This is the core idea behind this game. So when both players raise their hands, they can either lose, win, or tie by using the same hand gesture. In theory, this game should be fair no matter the strategy chosen as there is no best response to any option.
